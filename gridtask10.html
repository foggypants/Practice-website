            <p>Why do we check browser support?</p>
            <p>We check to ensure that users on older browsers don't see a broken or messy layout if their browser doesn't understand modern CSS Grid.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>What happens if Grid is not supported?</p>
            <p>The browser simply ignores the code inside the @supports block and falls back to a simpler layout like Block or Flexbox.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>Is this needed for all projects?</p>
            <p>No, it is only necessary if your target audience uses very old browsers (like Internet Explorer) or if you are using brand-new CSS features.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>Who uses this in real projects?</p>
            <p>Professional web developers working on large-scale websites (like banks or government sites) use this to guarantee accessibility for everyone.</p>

            <p>What does safe CSS mean?</p>
            <p>Safe CSS refers to writing code that includes fallbacks, ensuring the website remains readable and functional even if some styling fails.</p>
