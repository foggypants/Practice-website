        <p>Why are template areas easy to understand?</p>
        <p>They use descriptive names like "header" and "footer," making the layout visual and readable directly in the CSS code.</p>

    <div>
        <p>Which section spans full width?</p>
        <p>The sections where the name is repeated across all columns, such as "header header" or "footer footer," span the full width.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Can we rearrange layout by changing area names?</p>
        <p>Yes, you can swap the positions of the names in the grid-template-areas property to move sections without touching the HTML.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Is this better than column numbers?</p>
        <p>It is often better for complex layouts because you don't have to keep track of line numbers or math; you just draw the map with text.</p>

    <div>
        <p>Where are template areas mostly used?</p>
