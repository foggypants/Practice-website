                <p>What is the difference between a normal div and a grid container?</p>
                <p>A normal div stacks elements vertically by default as independent blocks. A grid container takes control of its children, turning them into grid items that follow a coordinate-based layout system.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                  <p>Why does the layout look the same even after applying Grid?</p>
                  <p>By default, a grid has only one column, so items stack vertically just like they did before. Without defining columns or rows, the browser doesn't have the instructions needed to move items side-by-side.</p>
             </div>
             <div>
                  <p>Are grid items created automatically?</p>
                  <p>Yes, any direct child of a container becomes a grid item</p>
             </div>
             <div>
                  <p>Can Grid work without rows or columns?</p>
                  <p>Yes, it creates "implicit" rows automatically to hold your content if you don't define them.</p>
             </div>
             <div>
                  <p>What do you think Grid needs to show visible changes?</p>
                  <p>It requires properties like grid-template-columns to break the single-column default and arrange items horizontally.</p>
