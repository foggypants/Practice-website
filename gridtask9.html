        <div class="span-6">
            <p>Why is 12-column grid popular?</p>
            <p>It is popular because 12 is highly divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6, allowing for many symmetrical layout options like halves, thirds, and quarters.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="span-3">
            <p>How does spanning help layout?</p>
            <p>Spanning allows specific elements to take up more space, helping to create a visual hierarchy where important content stands out.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>Where is this system used?</p>
            <p>This system is the standard for most professional web frameworks like Bootstrap and in print design for magazines and newspapers.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>Can we create layouts without this system?</p>
            <p>Yes, you can use any number of columns (like 5 or 7), but 12-column systems are preferred for their flexibility and mathematical balance.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>What happens if column count changes?</p>
            <p>If the column count changes, the spanning values must be recalculated, or the items will overlap or leave unintentional empty gaps.</p>
