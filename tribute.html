                <h2>A Young Revolutionary</h2>
                <p>Born in 1907 in Banga (now in Pakistan), Bhagat Singh grew up in a family deeply involved in the struggle for Indian independence. The 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre left a lasting scar on his young mind, driving him toward the path of revolutionary resistance.</p>

                <h2>His Ideology</h2>
                <p>Unlike many of his contemporaries, Singh was a deep thinker and a voracious reader. He transitioned from purely nationalist views to a socialist and anarchist perspective, believing that independence was not just about replacing British rulers with Indian ones, but about ending the exploitation of man by man.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HSRA:-</strong> He was a key leader of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intellectualism:</strong> He wrote extensively on atheism and socialism while in prison.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-violence vs Resistance:</strong> He believed that "the bomb and the pistol do not make a revolution," but were sometimes necessary to make the "deaf hear."</li>

            <h3>The Ultimate Sacrifice</h3>
            <p>On March 23, 1931, at the age of just 23, Bhagat Singh, along with Rajguru and Sukhdev, was hanged by the British government. His courage in the face of death turned him into a folk hero across India.</p>
